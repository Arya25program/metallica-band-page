## 🤘 About Metallica

Metallica is one of the most influential heavy metal bands in the world, known for classics like *Enter Sandman*, *Master of Puppets*, and *Nothing Else Matters*. This page is a tribute to their music and legacy.


If you want, I can also make a **cooler, dark-mode themed README** with emojis, ASCII dividers, and a more "metal" aesthetic.
Do you want me to make that version too?
